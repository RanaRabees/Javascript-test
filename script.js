// First Question

// In this exercise we will create a number guessing game that takes user input
// and replies based on how accurate the user's guess was.
// 1. Create a variable to be used as the max value for the number guessing
// game.
// 2. Generate a random number for the solution using Math.random() and
// Math.floor() . You will also need to add 1 so that the value is
// returned as 1-[whatever the set max value is]. You can log this value to
// the console for development to see the value as you create the game,
// then when the game is complete you can comment out this console
// output.
// 3. Create a variable that will be used for tracking whether the answer is
// correct or not and set it to a default Boolean value of false . We can
// update it to be true if the user guess is a match.
// 4. Use a while loop to iterate a prompt that asks the user to enter a
// number between 1 and 5, and convert the response into a number in
// order to match the data type of the random number.
// 5. Inside the while loop, check using a condition to see if the prompt
// value is equal to the solution number. Apply logic such that if the
// number is correct, you set the status to true and break out of the loop.
// Provide the player with some feedback as to whether the guess was
// high or low, and initiate another prompt until the user guesses
// correctly. In this way we use the loop to keep asking until the solution
// is correct, and at that point we can stop the iteration of the block of
// code.



// function Numberguessinggame() {
//     const randomnum = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1) + 0;

//     let usernum = Number(prompt('Enter a number between 1 and 5 :'));

//     while (usernum !== randomnum) {
//         usernum = Number(prompt('Enter a number between 1 and 5 :'));
//     }

//     if (usernum == randomnum) {
//         document.write('CONGRATULATIONS!!! You Guess A Correct Number. Correct Answer Was ' + guess + "  ");
//     }

//     else if (usernum > randomnum) {
//         guess++;
//         alert("OOPS SORRY!! Your guess was high ðŸ˜‰");
//     }
//     else {
//         guess++;
//         alert("OOPS SORRY!! Your guess was low ðŸ˜‰")
//     }

// }
